# HZE ions: Ground-based Radiation Study

NASA grant NNX12AB54G.

This package contains R code optimized for mapping binary phenotypes, such as neoplasia, to reveal genomic loci that confer susceptibility or resistance to radiation-associated phenotypes and to reveal conincident loci between different phenotypes. Additoinally, mapping with a Cox Proportional Hazards algorithm allows analysis of time-to-event endpoints. For the attached data, time to event data includes cataractogenesis, tumor latencies, and lifespan.

Space travel exposes astronauts to a unique, densely ionizing radiation—HZE ions— however the differential carcinogenicity for this radiation quality is poorly characterized in genetically diverse populations. To date, most radiation carcinogenesis studies have used inbred strains of mice and rats, or stocks with limited genetic heterogeneity. These studies have provided valuable information on the relative biological efficiencies of various radiation qualities, however, the advent of advanced heterogeneous mouse stocks, inexpensive high-throughput single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping, and new bioinformatic approaches allows the study of radiation carcinogenesis in genetically diverse populations. These tools allow for unprecedented genomic studies with fine mapping resolution to determine differential genomic susceptibility loci following exposure to HZE or γ-ray irradiation.
